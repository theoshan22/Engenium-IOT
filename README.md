# Engenium-IOT

Engenium IOT is a water presence notification system that can be used on farm bore holes to notify users that the water is below or above a certain level or 
used in a flood warning system. This can be extended to other IOT devices such as magnetic tamper sensors or temperature probes.
It uses SQL Server, Sigfox IOT Devices, Expo React and .NetCore

Makes use of  :
Cloud Message - Push notifications (FCM)
Public API (An api I created with .NET CORE)
GPS - To get the location of the device
Camera - To Scan QR Codes
Sigfox - Protocol used by the IOT device to communicate with the server even though there is no Cellphone signal
SQL Server + Entity Framework


There are no requriements needed to reproduce this project as far as I know.
